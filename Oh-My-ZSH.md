## How to load a plugin
You can either add the plugin in `~/.zshrc` then reload the shell by sourcing `~/.zshrc` or load it from the plugin directory. 

The second option will let you try a plugin without adding it in `.zshrc` or enable it without reloading the entire config.

This is an example for the plugin `battery`:

`source $ZSH/plugins/battery/battery.plugin.zsh`
